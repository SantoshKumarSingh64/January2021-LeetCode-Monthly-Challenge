<h1>Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters</h1>
<p><br>
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.<br>
<br> 
Example 1:<br>
&emsp; &emsp; Input: s = "abcabcbb"<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Output: 3<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.<br>
<br>
Example 2:<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Input: s = "bbbbb"<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Output: 1<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.<br>
<br>
Example 3:<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Input: s = "pwwkew"<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Output: 3<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.<br>
<br>
Example 4:<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Input: s = ""<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Output: 0<br>
<br>
<br>
Constraints:<br>
&emsp; &emsp;•	0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104<br>
&emsp; &emsp;•	s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.<br>
