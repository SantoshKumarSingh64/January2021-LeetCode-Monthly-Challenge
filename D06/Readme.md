<h1>Kth Missing Positive Number</h1>
<br>
</p>
Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.<br>
Find the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.<br>
 <br>
Example 1:<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Output: 9<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.<br>
<br>
Example 2:<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Output: 6<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.<br>
 <br>
Constraints:<br>
&emsp; &emsp;•	1 <= arr.length <= 1000<br>
&emsp; &emsp;•	1 <= arr[i] <= 1000<br>
&emsp; &emsp;•	1 <= k <= 1000<br>
&emsp; &emsp;•	arr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length<br>
<br></p>
