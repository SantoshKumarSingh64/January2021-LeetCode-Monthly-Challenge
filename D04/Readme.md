<h1 style="color:blue;"> Merge Two Sorted Lists </h1>
<p><br>
<br>
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.<br>
<br> 
Example 1:<br>
<br>
&emsp; &emsp;<img src = "https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg">
 <br>
 <br>
&emsp; &emsp;Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]<br>
<br>
Example 2:<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Input: l1 = [], l2 = []<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Output: []<br>
<br>
Example 3:<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Output: [0]<br>
<br>
<br>
Constraints:<br>
&emsp; •	The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].<br>
&emsp; •	-100 <= Node.val <= 100<br>
&emsp; •	Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.<br>
